=Discord-Minimal-Role-Control-Bot=
This is a minimal bot written in node.js for controlling roles of discord users on a single guild's "server". 
Commands are issued over unauthenticated websocket connections (recommend allowing localhost only, actually lock it down folks).
The following options should be set in the config.json file:
* host: location of mysql database (used to store queue when discord bot encounters connection issues)
* localOnly: boolean dictating if headers should be checked for local address
* user: database user
* password: database user password
* db: database which should be connected to (will use bot_queue table)
* port: database port to connect to
* discord_guild_id: id of guild to control
* discord_bot_token: bot token from the discord developer interface

Please be aware, this has been created in a rather rudimentary fashion at this time to allow a minimal set of abilities. 
The possible commands over websockets are as follows:
* role_add <user_id> <role_name(case insensitive)>
* role_remove <user_id> <role_name(case insensitive)>

The bot must be present in the server where these functions are to be performed.
Enjoy!
